## How To Use Pride?

Pride will be extended with many features and possibilities in the next days and weeks. Therefore it is possible that this description could change drastically in the course of the changes. 

#### Where is my documentation?

As an exemplary 'leisure developer' I would like to point out that there is a constantly updated documentation. You can find it [here](https://sebenns.github.io/Pride/globals.html). :hamster:

#### Requirements

**Node.js 12.0.0 or newer is required.**  
To use Pride locally or externally on a server you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).  
Get the project, install all necessary dependencies with `npm install` and start Pride with `npm start`.

## How To Extend Pride?

Extending Pride is as easy as it sounds. At least as long as it's not core functionality and your purpose is to get your own events and commands.
