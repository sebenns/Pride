# Pride - Discord Botframework

Pride is an OpenSource Bot Framework, which allows you to add or develop your own events and commands by drag'n'drop. 
The bot is written in Typescript and is based on the DiscordJS library. 

### Features

- You have your own bot, and it is completely customizable. :sunglasses:
- You can easily add new commands. All by drag'n'drop! 
- Commands can also be added at runtime of your bot. :fire:
- The same applies to events.

For Example: Should you ever want to react to role changes, no problem!  
Create an event, throw it in, give the bot a reload command and your changes are in.
